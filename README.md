# Loan-Approval-Using-XAI
This project builds an end-to-end Loan Approval Prediction System using Machine Learning integrated with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency, fairness, and interpretability in financial decision-making.  The system predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.
# 🧠 Explainable AI System for Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning system to predict loan approval decisions and provides deep model interpretability using multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

The goal is to transform a black-box ensemble model into a transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy decision system for financial applications.
